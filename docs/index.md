# Introduction

The SQL Chatter Project showcases two innovative approaches to simplifying database interactions using advanced AI technologies: GitHub Copilot and Azure OpenAI. Both versions of the project aim to streamline the process of querying an Azure SQL Database, making it accessible even to users without extensive SQL knowledge.

In the **GitHub Copilot Version**, developers leverage GitHub Copilot to efficiently create a .NET Core Web API backend and a Blazor Web App frontend. Copilot assists in generating SQL queries and code, enhancing productivity and reducing development time.

In the **Azure OpenAI Version**, the project utilizes Azure OpenAI to convert natural language inputs into SQL queries. This eliminates the need for users to write SQL queries manually, allowing them to interact with the database using simple, conversational language.

Both versions highlight the power of AI in automating complex tasks, improving efficiency, and making technology more accessible to a broader audience.
