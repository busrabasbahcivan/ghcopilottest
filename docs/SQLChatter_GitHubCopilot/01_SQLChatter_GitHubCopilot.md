# SQL Chatter Project (GitHub Copilot Version)

This project demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot to efficiently develop a .NET Core Web API backend and a Blazor Web App frontend for querying an Azure SQL Database. Copilot helps generate SQL queries and code, streamlining the development process.

We set up a microservices-based backend to handle SQL queries from the frontend, which allows users to input queries through the Blazor Web App. The Web API processes the queries and returns results in real-time.

Using GitHub Copilot simplifies coding tasks, automates query generation, and enhances overall productivity, making complex projects easier to manage and execute.

## ✍️ Prerequisites

❗Before beginning this exercise, it is essential to have an active Azure subscription.

To do this exercise, you need GitHub Copilot and a supported IDE like VS Code. You can install these on your computer or use Codespaces instead.

* For the development tool, ensure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.

* If you do not have an active GitHub Copilot licence, you can sign up for trial [here](https://github.com/settings/copilot).

* For IDE extension, install [Visual Studio Code Copilot Extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/getting-code-suggestions-in-your-ide-with-github-copilot?tool=vscode).

   _**Note:** This extension includes both GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat. If you have problem installing GitHub Copilot Chat, you can directly install the extension for Visual Studio Code [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)._
