## 2. Creating a Sample Database in Azure Portal:

* The Azure Portal offers an option to use the **AdventureWorksLT** sample database with data. (AdventureWorksLT sample database includes all the tables we provide in the prompt, so we can directly use this). 

   If youâ€™re unsure how to create this database, you can simply ask Copilot and follow the steps it provides:

    ```
    I'd like to create the AdventureWorksLT sample database with data in the Azure portal using SQL authentication. How can I do that?
    ```

* Create a SQL Database which GitHub Copilot explained above in detail or follow these steps:
  * Open your web browser and go to the [Azure Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/). 
  * Sign in with your Azure account credentials.
  * In the left-hand menu, click on **"Create a resource"**.
  * Search for **"SQL Database"** and select it from the list.
  * Click on **"Create"** to start the setup process.
  * Configure Basic Settings
    * **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.
    * **Resource Group**: Create a new resource group named **"AIChatterResource"**.
    * **Database Name**: Enter **"AIChatterDB"** for your database name.
    * **Server**: Create a new server named **"aichatterserver"**. Select **"East US"** or any other location for Location step. For authentication, please select **"Use both SQL and Microsoft Entra authentication"** and provide server admin login and password. (Please note this admin user and password for the source code configuration later.)
  Select yourself as **"Microsoft Entra admin"** from the list then click **"OK"**:

   * **Networking**: 

     * Ensure to add your current client IP address to the server firewall rules to allow access.
     * You can do this by clicking on **"Public endpoint"** as "Connectivity method" and adding your current client IP address:

   * **Review and Create**: 
       * Review all the settings and click on **"Create"** to deploy the SQL database:

 * Now, you have a database with sample data that has the same schema structure as the SalesLT database you provided in the prompt.
